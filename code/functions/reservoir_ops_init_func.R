# Defines a function that takes a Reservoir object and creates a dataframe 
#   containing initial day storage and release time series 
#   
#   input: res is all of the info in the reservoir class object
#          res@name is the reservoir name
#          res@capacity is the reservoir capacity
#          res@stor0 is the initial storage on day 1 of the simulation
#          res@flowby is the minimum environmental flowby over the dam
#          res@inflows is a dataframe containing the daily inflow time series
#   input: withdr_req is the requested withdrawal from an intake in the reservoir
#   input: ws_rel_req is the requested release over the dam for ws purposes
#          if ws_rel_req > flowby then rel = ws_rel_req (assuming enough water)
#          if ws_rel_req <= flowby then rel = flowby (assuming enough water)
#
#   output: dataframe with columns: date_time, stor, inflow, rel, withdr
